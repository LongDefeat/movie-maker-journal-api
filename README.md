# Movie Maker Journal - Backend

This project is fullstack app modeled somewhat after Letterbox'd, but of course, with my own flare.

Frontend Code: https://github.com/LongDefeat/movie-maker-journal-app

The purpose of this app is purely to display modern programming practices in React such as:

- built with express in node.js
- authentication with json web token
- user database created with postgres
- user authentication
- deployment to Heroku
